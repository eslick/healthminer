# HealthMiner

## A collection of tools for semantic analysis of patient forums

The goal of this project was to extract relational knowledge from open
text, akin to the conceptminer project but with a much more
sophisticated set of analytical tools.  This library in part was
extracted from the old conceptminer system.

Alot of this code is a wrapper around external tools like Mallet.
